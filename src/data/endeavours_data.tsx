            `This Endeavour allows you to store funds for future use. As noted in Money to Burn, all coin remaining at the end of your ‘Between Adventures’ phase is lost before the next adventure begins unless it is saved with this Endeavour. So, if you have a lot of money spare it may be worth a trip to the bank. If you are using a Banking Endeavour to retain your money, you must first decide whether to save your money by investing it with a reputable banking institution, or to stash it somewhere less secure.
    
            Investing: You must be of the Gold and Silver social tiers to save with a banking house. Your money will be reasonably safe and it should accrue interest. When undertaking a Banking Endeavour to deposit money in a bank, determine the interest rate of your account, by choosing a number between 1 and 10 (alternatively you may simply roll 1d10). This is the rate of interest you will accrue, and also how risky the investment is. Withdrawing funds requires another Banking Endeavour. This may take place immediately after the initial Endeavour, or after subsequent adventures have occurred. Roll 1d100: if you roll equal to or less than your rate of interest, the venture has gone bankrupt and you have lost all of your money. If you roll over the interest rate, you receive your initial funds, plus the interest accrued.

            Stashing: All characters may choose to stash their loot. This is a risky strategy, involving hiding it on your person, in your mattress, or burying it somewhere. Stashed money never accrues any interest. Players may withdraw money from a stash before the start of an adventure, without undertaking an Endeavour. Roll 1d100: if you roll 10 or lower, your stash has been found and you have lost all your money, otherwise you recieve your initial funds. If you successfully withdraw your funds they will be available for you when you start your next adventure, in addition to any funds secured via an Income Endeavour`,

        type: 'endeavour', name: 'Consult an Expert', content:
            `The Old World is replete with ancient and arcane knowledge, yet this information is not readily available on some magical box in your pocket. If you want to seek out some piece of obscure arcana, you must first seek out an expert. You may undertake the Consult an Expert Endeavour either to facilitate another Endeavour for example: Commission, Training, or Unusual Learning Endeavours), or to secure a piece of specific knowledge.

            There are two stages to this Endeavour: locating the expert, then consulting.

            First, you must locate your expert (this stage may be skipped with the GM’s permission if you have already identified an appropriate expert during your adventures). Attempt a Challenging (+0) Gossip Test (the Difficulty of this Test will vary according to the size of the settlement where your character is currently living). If you succeed, you have located your expert. If you fail, you have located the loudest self-proclaimed specialist in your location, and the GM is given free rein to vary the quality or accuracy of the advice procured. You can of course refuse to deal with this somewhat suspect source, but you never know if you might have found a diamond in the rough. GMs are contrary like that sometimes.

            Once successfully locate an expert, you then need to convince them to talk with you. Depending on what you wish to know, this may require no more than a Simple Charm Test or a modest donation to the local Temple of Verena. In more extreme cases, you may have to commit to performing one or more Favours (see Do Me A Favour!) which may be called in during a future adventure, or ‘bought off ’ by spending Endeavours between future adventures. The level of Favour owed depends on the complexity — and danger — of the information you want as determined by the GM.

            The precise nature of the information gleaned depends on the expert consulted and what you seek to know. Academics will know the origins and full history on a subject with which they are familiar; wizards of the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf understand the history of magic and various mystical objects, particularly aspects relevant to their own order; an Apothecary General can identify even the rarest poison; a Verenan scholar may have information relating to any number of historical incidents. In short, the expert’s background will influence how the knowledge is presented, and with which biases.

            In addition to any specific information the GM imparts to their player, a successful Consult an Expert Endeavour used to seek out knowledge (and not to facilitate another Endeavour) gives you an Expert Reroll (mark this on your character sheet under Notes). This reroll may only be used on a Test specifically relating to the lore revealed and must be used before the end of your next adventure.`,
